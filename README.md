# Sorting Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

A sorting visualizer for several different sorting algorithms: 
1) Bubble sort (time complexity: O(n^2)
2) Insertion sort ( time complexity: O(n^2)
3) Merge sort (time complexity: O(nlogn)
4) Quick Sort (avg time complexity: O(nlogn)- worse case: O(n^2) (when already sorted and highest or lowest element is chosen)
5) Heap Sort (time complexity: O(nlogn)

Has the ability to generate new random arrays, increase/ decrease sort speed, and change array size.
